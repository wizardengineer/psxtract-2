psxtract-2
==========

Tool to decrypt and convert PSOne Classics from PSP/PS3.
Originally written by **Hykem**.

This fork adds native macOS and Linux support (no Wine required).

This tool allows you to decrypt a PSOne Classics EBOOT.PBP on your PC.
It features a modified version of libkirk's source code to support DES
encryption/decryption and the AMCTRL functions.
Also features isofix code for ensuring finalized ISO matches real discs.
On Windows, uses the ATRAC3 ACM codec for audio decoding. On macOS/Linux,
uses ffmpeg instead.


Building
--------

**macOS / Linux:**

```
make
```

Requires a C/C++ toolchain (Xcode CLT on macOS, `build-essential` on Debian/Ubuntu,
`base-devel` on Arch).

For ATRAC3 audio track conversion, install the ffmpeg development libraries
before building. The Makefile auto-detects them via `pkg-config`; if they are
not found, psxtract still builds but audio tracks are left as `.AT3` files.

```
# macOS
brew install ffmpeg

# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libswresample-dev libavutil-dev

# Arch
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg
```

**Windows (cross-compile with MinGW):**

```
make windows
```

Or build natively on Windows with the MinGW toolchain.


Notes
-------

Output of running `psxtract EBOOT.PBP` (or `psxtract.exe` on Windows) is two
files - CDROM.BIN and CDROM.CUE in the current directory. You should know what
to do with those.

Using the "-c" option on the command line, psxtract will clean up any
temporary files it generates while it runs (of which there are many).
This flag is kept for backwards compatibility with old psxtract that used
it to force CDROM creation. Current version always creates a BIN/CUE pair
but we keep the flag for nostalgia.

**Audio decoding:**
- **Windows:** The ATRAC3 ACM codec must be installed on the system.
- **macOS / Linux:** Uses the ffmpeg libraries (libavcodec) linked at build
  time. If built without ffmpeg, audio tracks are left as `.AT3` files.

You may supply a KEYS.BIN file to the tool, but this is not necessary.
Using the internal files' hashes, psxtract can calculate the key by itself.

Game file manual decryption is also supported (DOCUMENT.DAT).

Working games and compatibility
-------------------------------

Nearly all PSN eboots should be supported. Some known problems are mentioned in the bug tracker:

  https://github.com/has207/psxtract-2/issues

If you encounter issues with a particular game report it there, but in general the game should
be fully playable even in those cases where we have md5 sum mismatches vs redump.org.

Generally speaking BIN/CUE pair created by this tool SHOULD match information on redump.org,
in other words all .BIN files should be the correct size and match md5 hashes
of a real disc dump.

However, if the game has CDDA audio audio tracks, i.e. 2 or more tracks per BIN, those audio
track md5 sums will NOT match redump.org info. This is working as intended, we generate the
audio tracks with the correct size and as close to original as possible. However, as we're dealing
with a lossy compression to ATRAC3, the conversion back to raw audio necessarily results in md5 hash
mismatches for the audio tracks.

The easiest way to verify hashes is by importing the game into Duckstation and checking hashes from
the game Properties menu.

There is one additional known issue that is actually working as intended -- with Resident Evil 2 Dualshock Edition. The EBOOT for that game retains
CUE entries and pointers to audio tracks, however these were not included in the EBOOT.
The audio tracks present on the physical discs are empty so this is not a real loss, just an issue
with the EBOOT itself, so there will be warnings when this EBOOT is extracted but the resulting
BIN/CUE is fully playable.
